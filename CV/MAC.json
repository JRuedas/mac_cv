      "description": "My job goals are oriented to the field of DevOps/SRE, Cloud and Software Development/Architecture.\n\nI strongly believe there is always room for improvement. Therefore, I am always trying to learn something new. Nowadays, I combine my work with an online master's degree in Development and Operations (DevOps) at International University of La Rioja (UNIR) and C2 level English studies at the Official School of Languages.\n\nI am currently employed as DevOps Engineer at Deveryware where I am focused on automating and improving the product lifecycle. Besides, I am also responsible for designing the application infrastructure and deploying the product in several environments. Apart from that, I also provide customer support and oversee the product operation team.\n\nIn addition, I worked as a Backend Software Engineer at Technical University of Madrid where I developed and maintained several Java applications. I have also worked as Mobile Software Engineer during almost two years at the same place.\n\nPrior to that, I was employed as Software developer at Coritel (Accenture)  where I was assigned to a project in collaboration with Renfe.\n\nAs far my studies are concerned, I finished my HNC programming studies in 2015 which led me to find my first job in the industry. While I was working, I decided to rejoin University to finish my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science & Engineering. In 2019, I graduated from Technical University of Madrid, and decided to enroll the master’s degree which I finished two years later in 2021.",
